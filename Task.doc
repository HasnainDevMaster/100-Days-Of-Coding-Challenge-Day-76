DNS (Domain Name System)
DNS, or Domain Name System, functions as the internet's phonebook,
translating human-readable domain names like www.example.com into machine-readable IP addresses such as 192.0.2.1.
This conversion is essential because computers rely on IP addresses to identify and communicate with each other across the internet,
while people prefer using easily memorable names.

How DNS Works:
 1. User Request: When a user enters a domain name like example.com in their browser,
 the request is sent to the DNS resolver (usually provided by the user's ISP or local network).

 2. DNS Resolver: The resolver queries different DNS servers to resolve the domain name to an IP address.

 3. Root Server: The resolver first contacts a root DNS server,

 which directs it to the appropriate top-level domain (TLD) server based on the domain extension (e.g., .com, .org).

 4. TLD Server: The TLD server refers the resolver to the authoritative DNS server responsible for the specific domain (e.g., example.com).

 5. Authoritative DNS Server: This server provides the final IP address for the domain.

 6. Response: The DNS resolver sends the IP address back to the browser, allowing it to connect to the web server hosting the site.

Example:
When you visit www.google.com, the DNS translates the domain name into its IP address (e.g., 172.217.11.174).
This IP address is then used by your browser to access the Google server and load the website.

DNS Hierarchy:
DNS operates in a hierarchical structure:

 * Root Servers: Direct traffic to the appropriate TLD servers.
 * TLD Servers: Handle domain extensions like .com, .org, and direct traffic to authoritative servers.
 * Authoritative Servers: Provide the IP addresses for specific domains.

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
DHCP, or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, is a network protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other communication parameters to devices on a network.
This process simplifies device configuration, allowing devices to connect and communicate with minimal manual intervention.

How DHCP Works:
 1. DHCP Discover: When a device (like a computer or smartphone) connects to a network, it broadcasts a DHCP Discover message, requesting an IP address.

 2. DHCP Offer: A DHCP server (usually the router) responds with an available IP address and other network configuration details,
 such as subnet mask, gateway, and DNS server addresses.

 3. DHCP Request: The device accepts the offer by sending a DHCP Request message.

 4. DHCP Acknowledgment: The server confirms the assignment with a DHCP Acknowledgment message, and the device can now use the assigned IP address to communicate on the network.

Example:
When you connect your laptop to a Wi-Fi network, DHCP automatically assigns an IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100) to your device.
Without DHCP, you'd have to manually assign an IP address and configure network settings.

DHCP Lease:
The IP address assigned to a device is temporary and referred to as a "lease." Once the lease expires,
the device must either renew it or request a new IP address from the DHCP server.

Conclusion
Both DNS and DHCP play critical roles in making modern networks efficient:

 * DNS ensures that users can access websites using simple domain names instead of complex IP addresses.
 * DHCP automates the configuration of devices on a network, enabling them to communicate with each other effortlessly without manual setup.
 Together, they allow seamless network and internet access across devices.
